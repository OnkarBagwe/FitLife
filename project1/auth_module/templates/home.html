        <h4>In a pandemic situation when everyone is supposed to stay in their house, exercise and yoga is one thing which everybody must do. But as there is no trainer to train them, people end up doing it wrong and end up gaining nothing from it. People are also prone to several injuries due to incorrect posture. </h4>
        <h4>An Australian study on the causes of injuries at fitness facilities also indicates that overexertion, strenuous and unnatural movement causes over 36% of fitness injuries â€” the highest among the six common causes of injury.This explains the importance of correct posture while doing exercises and asanas.
          </h4>
        <h4>FitLife is an application which will tell you the proper posture of the exercise you are performing and monitor your posture throughout. The application tries to correct your posture by giving audio feedback so that you place your body properly and do your exercise perfectly.

          <h4 class="card-description "> Gym exercises majorly consist of weight training, cardiovascular training and mobility training</h4>

          <h4 class="card-description "> Weight training is an organized exercise in which muscles of the body are forced to contract under tension using weights, body weight or other devices in order to stimulate growth, strength, power, and endurance.</h4>

          <h4 class="card-description">
            Cardiovascular training is defined as any type of exercise that gets your heart rate up and keeps it up for a prolonged period of time. Your respiratory system will start working harder as you begin to breathe faster and more deeply.</h4>

          <h4 class="card-description">
          Mobility training combines mobility exercises that increase the range of movements and motions your body can perform. These include flexibility, but also balance, pliability and strength. The full combination is the best way to avoid injury. One great thing about mobility training is its diversity.
