          <h4>Yoga's origins can be traced to northern India over 5,000 years ago. The word yoga was first mentioned in ancient sacred texts called the Rig Veda. The Vedas are a set of four ancient sacred texts written in Sanskrit. </h4>
          <h4>If you’ve ever taken a yoga class (and if you haven't, you should!), you may have heard some words that you couldn't recognize. The language of yoga is actually Sanskrit, the root of many Indian languages and one of the oldest of in the world.</h4>
          <h4><i>Āsana:</i>  
            Literally translated as seat, the term āsana these days is used to refer to the practice of physical yoga postures or poses.</h4>
        <h4><i>
            Prānāyāma:
            </i>Prāna in Sanskrit refers to the life force within every being. In relation to modern-day yoga classes, the term prānāyāma is used to describe breathing exercises, which clear the physical and emotional obstacles in our body to free the breath.</h4>

        <h4>

            When starting with yoga, there will be certain postures which become the foundation of your yoga practice. Anchoring your practice with these postures allows you to reap the benefits of yoga - flexibility, improved muscle strength, protection of the spine, increased blood flow, and even improved happiness.</h4>

            This is derived from two words ‘vriksha’, which means tree in Sanskrit, and ‘asana’, which means posture. This ‘tree pose’ dates back to ancient mythology, and there are in fact references of it in the Ramayana. Lord Ravana stood in vrikshasana for penance, praying to Lord Shiva for a boon, and the posture has been considered powerful ever since
